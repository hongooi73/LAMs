# LAMs!

Add Land-Air Mechs (LAMs) to Expanded Arsenal/Elite Arsenal. LAMs are fast, agile and highly maneuverable, but also relatively fragile. Keep them alive, and they can devastate the enemy with pinpoint strikes far from the frontline.

This mod adds the following LAMs to the game:

- Phoenix Hawk LAM PHX-HK1
- Shadow Hawk LAM SHD-X1
- Shadow Hawk LAM SHD-X2
- Stinger LAM STG-A1
- Waneta S-WN-2LAM
- Wasp LAM WSP-100B
- Yurei S-YR-1LAM
- Phoenix Hawk LAM X PHX-LAM-X
- Phoenix Hawk LAM S PHX-LAM-S
- Shadow Hawk LAM X SHD-LAM-X
- Shadow Hawk LAM S SHD-LAM-S
- Stinger LAM X STG-LAM-X
- Stinger LAM S STG-LAM-S
- Waneta X WN-LAM-X
- Waneta S WN-LAM-S
- Wasp LAM X WSP-LAM-X
- Wasp LAM S WSP-LAM-S
- Yurei X YR-LAM-X
- Yurei S YR-LAM-S

The S-tier variants are only found in the elite missions from Elite Arsenal.

This mod requires Elite Arsenal. It can be enabled and disabled at will; if you disable it, any LAMs in your inventory will remain functional but you won't meet any more LAMs until it is re-enabled.


## Implementation details

LAMs in Expanded Arsenal are a simplified treatment of the concept, compared to the tabletop game. Because EA is deliberately a lightweight mod, features like transforming, hovering, flight and bomb bays are missing. Instead, LAMs are treated as being permanently in AirMech mode, with large bonuses to jump distance and slightly reduced ground speed.

A LAM has the following buffs compared to regular mechs:

- Total ~240% multiplier to jump distance, stacking with items like improved and advanced jump jets
- +10 extra heatsinking
- 2 extra evasion pips on movement, stacking with the level 5 Piloting ability

Because of streamlining and weight constraints, a LAM _cannot_ make use of the Elite Arsenal defensive items (Passive Defensive Matrix, Hybrid Defensive Package, Heavy Defensive Suite). These represent add-on armour, sensor gear and other protective modifications that would interfere with its aerodynamics. However, an X-tier LAM gains an inherent +10% damage reduction from improved armour, and similarly an S-tier LAM gains +15% damage reduction.

LAMs are thus extremely agile and evasive, but cannot take sustained punishment like regular mechs.
