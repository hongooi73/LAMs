## v2.0.0

Version 2.0 replaces the original in-game models with better-looking ones, based on the original Robotech/Macross mecha. Huge props to the modders who created these models!

### New content

New in this version is a 3-skull flashpoint that is unlocked after completing the first few elite flashpoints in Elite Arsenal. A Word of Blake resource extraction operation on an unclaimed world leads to a secret facility, where a powerful mech is located. Completing the flashpoint will allow the Clan designs below to spawn in missions, and reward you with a unique capstone LAM!

New Clan designs, original to EA and the handiwork of Clan Diamond Shark:
- Black Falcon BF-LAM-1
- Firebird FB-LAM-1
- Jaguar JGR-LAM-1
- Lancer LNC-LAM-1
- Saber SBR-LAM-1
- Thunderbird TB-LAM-1
- White Eagle WE-LAM-1

### Changes/bugfixes

- Reduce the chance of encountering a full lance of LAMs, especially in lower-difficulty missions
- Elite Word of Blake LAMs (Waneta X/S, Yurei X/S) now mount C3i computers; the ER large laser has been replaced with lighter weapons to compensate
