    "Details" : "The Word of Blake was a splinter faction of ComStar that originated from a reactionary backlash against the removal of ComStar's mystical and religious aspects. The Blakists initially found refuge in the Free Worlds League, before conquering Terra and becoming a major Inner Sphere faction in their own right. Notorious for their extreme brutality and fanaticism, the Word of Blake would eventually instigate the Jihad, an interstellar crusade seeking to unite the Inner Sphere in the name of Jerome Blake.",
