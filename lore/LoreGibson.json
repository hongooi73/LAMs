    "Details" : "Gibson was originally a prosperous manufacturing world in the Free Worlds League, known for the presence of Gibson Federated BattleMechs, a major 'Mech manufacturing concern. The Word of Blake found refuge there after their schism with Comstar, causing conflicts with the native population and, ultimately, the detonation of a tactical nuclear warhead over the planet's capital. Now fully controlled by the Word of Blake, Gibson has been the subject of multiple bombardments and assaults from the Word's enemies, reducing it to a ruined hellscape.",
