    "Details" : "A Land-Air 'Mech, or LAM for short, is a hybrid of an aerospace fighter and a BattleMech. LAMs have excellent agility compared to 'Mechs, being able to make what are essentially short flights over hundreds of meters. However, they also tend to be more fragile and vulnerable to damage, and their streamlining means they cannot take advantage of add-on defensive modifications like 'Mechs can. LAMs are limited to 55 tons or less.",
