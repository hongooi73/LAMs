    "Name" : "Kearnyfuchidite",
    "Details" : "In astrogeology, kearnyfuchidite is a mineral that forms when silicate rocks containing trace amounts of tantalum and manganese are exposed to the radiation from a failed FTL jump. Nonexistent at the dawn of the age of space travel, it has become more common in the Succession Wars era since the decline of technology has led to more jump mishaps. It can be made into superalloys that combine light weight with exceptional heat resistance.",
